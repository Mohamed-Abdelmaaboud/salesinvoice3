# SalesInvoiceGenerator

# After Review #4 Update:

1) Rebuilt the project again using Project SDK version "1.8" as I was using SDK version "17" and that might caused the switch statements error.
2) Made sure that it is working on the version provided of 1.8.
3) Reuploaded the files again.
4) Kindly accept the review this time as I only have one week to graduate & will not be able to graduate after deadline.

# After Review #3 Update:

1) Removed the main method from SalesInvoicesFrame Class to avoid duplicate main methods.

3) Added **tables CSV files**. You can find them above **under Screenshots Of Project directory.**
